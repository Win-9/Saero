#service
service.title=We are
service.subTitle=Protect and register abandoned animals to find new families
service.p1=More than 100,000 animals are abandoned every year
service.p2=Abandoned animals are very hard to survive on the streets.
service.p3=It's very hard to get food and water to drink on the street. So you end up in danger of dying from malnutrition or dehydration.
service.p4=Even if you save it, you can get infected with a mask or parasite because of spoiled food, and you become very vulnerable to disease and lead a hard life
service.p5=Also, rescued children are forced to walk down the path of euthanasia unless they are left in poor protective conditions or adopted.
service.p6=We want to save these children and match new families to protect them from these risks.
service.p7=Please look around and adopt children from various shelters.
